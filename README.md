# Robwel.ch

This is the code that poweres robwel.ch, my personal portfolio website. It's a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) template built on top of the [Skeleton CSS framework](http://getskeleton.com/), and the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin.

If you want to use this for your own website, it might need some customising; my name and info are hardcoded into it! But you are more than welcome to try, as long as you're happy with the GPLv3.

* Advanced Custom Fields (at least 4.4.1.1)
